## Challenges Faced

2. Caching with React Query:
- The implementation of caching using React Query required learning and integrating this tool, ultimately enhancing the application's performance.

3. Responsive Design:
- Overcoming challenges in creating a responsive design involved delving into responsive web design principles and employing various CSS techniques.
