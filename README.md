## Challenges Faced

1. State Management:

- Initially I was unfamiliar with Zustand, But I took the challenge to learn it during the assignment, integrating it successfully into the application.

2. Caching with React Query:
- I was not knowing caching before so I researched about it on google and found that it can be integrated using React Query (TanStack Query), I learned it while doing the assignment and successfully integrated it.

3. Responsive Design:
- Perfecting the visual appearance of the website across diverse screens presented certain challenges. These included addressing variations in different browsers, optimizing images for optimal display, and ensuring a cohesive overall aesthetic. The resolution involved a meticulous process of adjustment to guarantee users a seamless and enjoyable experience, irrespective of the device they use.
